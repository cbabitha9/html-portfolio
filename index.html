        <h2>Hello World!</h2>
        <p class="intro">

          Software Engineer from Boston.

        <h2>MY SKILLS.</h2>
       
          <h3>MERN STACK</h3>
          <p>
            I am proficient with the MERN Stack
            (Mongodb, Express, React & Node). It
            is also very important to know that i
            know the basics in other languages as
            well and am really keen to learning
            new tech stack.
          </p>

          <h3>Teaching Coding</h3>
          <p>
            I figured out one of the best ways to
            learn is to teach. So I've learnt alot
            by teaching coding to others and I'm
            still building capacity day by day.
